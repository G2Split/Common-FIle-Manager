# File Manager / Common File Manager / Lua File Manager

This is a personal project that aims to be a useful and simple tool for managing files in general. The project was created to improve my skills in Lua, with its only concrete goal being to serve as a complete and practical file manager. **The limitation is to not turn this into a File Explorer 2.0 or something overly complex.**

PRs will not be accepted.

## Features:

* Create files
* Delete files
* Copy files
* Move files
* Rename files
* Edit files
* View files
* Select a file for consistent work on other operations (currently incomplete)

Currently built for Linux systems only.

## TODO (subject to change):

* Batch operations
* More sophisticated functions
* Full support for Windows and macOS
